# TSF-Linear-Regression
This project involved using linear regression in machine learning to predict the grades or scores of a student based on their study time of 9.25 hours per day. The project utilized the popular scikit-learn package in Python for implementing the linear regression model. The dataset for this project was already provided.

The project was carried out in Python programming language, utilizing Jupyter Notebook as the integrated development environment (IDE). The following steps were involved in the project:

Understanding the Data: The initial step involved gaining insights into the dataset, understanding its structure, and identifying the relevant variables for prediction.

Preprocessing the Data: This step focused on preparing the dataset for model training. It included tasks such as handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming data if necessary.

Training the Data: The dataset was divided into training and testing subsets. The training data was used to build the linear regression model, which aimed to capture the relationship between study time and scores.

Implementing and Developing a Linear Regression Model: The linear regression model was implemented using the scikit-learn package. This involved fitting the model to the training data and fine-tuning it for optimal performance.

Evaluating Results and Accuracy of Predictions: Once the model was developed, it was used to make predictions on the testing data. The accuracy of the predictions was evaluated by comparing them with the actual scores. This step helped assess the performance and effectiveness of the linear regression model.

Several Python libraries were utilized throughout the project, including:

NumPy: Used for numerical computations and array operations.

Seaborn: Used for data visualization and exploratory data analysis.

Scikit-learn: Used for implementing the linear regression model and performing machine learning tasks.

Matplotlib: Used for creating plots and visualizations.

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

Overall, this project aimed to leverage linear regression and machine learning techniques to predict student scores based on their study time, using a given dataset.
